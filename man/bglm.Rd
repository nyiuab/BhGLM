  Bayesian Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
}

\description{
  This function is to set up Bayesian hierarchical GLMs, and to fit the model using the EM-IWLS algorithm. 
  Four types of priors on each coefficient can be used: Student-t, double-exponential, spike-and-slab mixture Student-t, and spike-and-slab mixture double-exponential.  
  The Bayesian hierarchical GLMs include various models as special cases, e.g., classical GLMs, ridge regression, and Bayesian lasso. 
  It can be used for analyzing general data and large-scale and highly-correlated variables 
  (for example, detecting disease-associated factors and predicting phenotypes).

\usage{    
bglm(formula, family = gaussian, data, offset, weights, subset, na.action, 
    start = NULL, etastart, mustart, control = glm.control(epsilon = 1e-04, maxit = 50), 
    prior = Student(), group = NULL, method.coef,
    Warning = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)  
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{formula, family, data, offset, weights, subset, na.action, start, etastart, mustart, control}{ 
  These arguments are the same as in \code{\link{glm}}.
}
  \item{family}{
  can be all the standard families defined in \code{\link{glm}}. 
  also can be Negative Binomial (\code{NegBin or "NegBin"}).
}
  \item{prior}{
  Prior distribustions for the coefficents. Four types of priors can be used; Student-t: \code{Student(mean, scale, df, autoscale)} (default: mean=0, scale=0.5, df=1, autoscale=TRUE), Double-exponetial: \code{De(mean, scale, autoscale)} (default: mean=0, scale=0.5, autoscale=TRUE), mixture double-exponential: \code{mde(mean, s0, s1, b)}, and mixture Student-t: \code{mt(mean, s0, s1, df, b)}, s0 < s1, default: mean=0, s0=0.04, s1=0.5, df=1, b=1. 
  The \code{mean}, \code{scale}, \code{df} and \code{b} can be a vector. For example, scale = c(a1,a2,...,ak); if k < the total number of predictors, it is internally expanded to c(a1,a2,...,ak, rep(ak,J-k)). If \code{autoscale=TRUE}, \code{scale} will be modified internally (see details).
}
\item{group}{
  a numeric vector, or an integer, or a list definining the groups of predictors. Only used for \code{mde} or \code{mt} priors. 
  If \code{group = NULL}, all the predictors form a single group.
  If \code{group = K}, the predictors are evenly divided into groups each with \code{K} predictors.
  If \code{group} is a numberic vector, it defines groups as follows: Group 1: \code{(group[1]+1):group[2]}, Group 2: \code{(group[2]+1):group[3]}, Group 3: \code{(group[3]+1):group[4]}, .....  
  If \code{group} is a list of variable names, \code{group[[k]]} includes variables in the k-th group. 
}
\item{method.coef}{
  jointly updating all coefficients or updating coefficients group by group. The default is jointly updating.
  If \code{method.coef = NULL} or \code{method.coef} is missing, jointly updating.
  If \code{method.coef = K}, update \code{K} coefficients at a time.
  \code{method.coef} can be a numeric vector or a list of variable names (as defined by \code{group}) that defines groups.
  If the number of coefficients is large, the group-by-group updating method can be much faster than the jointly updating.
}
  \item{Warning}{
  logical. If \code{TRUE}, show the error messages of not convergence and identifiability.
}
  \item{verbose}{
  logical. If \code{TRUE}, print out number of iterations and computational time.
}

}

\details{
  This function sets up Bayesian hierarchical GLMs and fits the model using the EM-IWLS algorithm. It is an alteration of the standard function \code{\link{glm}} for classical GLMs, and includes all the \code{\link{glm}} arguments and also some new arguments for Bayesian modeling. 

  For the priors \code{Student} and \code{De}, if \code{autoscale=TRUE}, \code{scale} is modified internally: for a predictor with only one value nothing is changed; for a predictor x with exactly two unique values, we divide the user-specified scale \code{scale} by the range of x; for a predictor x with more than two unique values, we divide the user-specified scale by sd(x). For gaussian models, \code{scale} is further multiplied by sd(y).  
  
  The argument \code{group} is only used for the prior \code{mde} or \code{mt}, allowing for group-specific inclusion probabilities and thus incorporating group information (e.g. biological pathways). With the mixture prior, the predictors can be grouped or ungrouped. For ungrouped predictors, the prior is double-exponential or Student-t with scale \code{s1}. 
  
  The prior \code{mde(mean, s0, s1, b)} represents a mixture of \code{De(mean, s0)} and \code{De(mean, s1)} with group-specific inclusion probabilities following beta(1,b). The tuning parameter \code{b} can be a vector of group-specific values.   
   
}

\value{
  This function returns an object of class "glm", including all outputs from the function \code{\link{glm}}, and also results for the additional parameters in the hierarchical models.
